## General info

This Git repository contains python codes for constructing Grassmannian diffusion maps-based adaptive polynomial chaos expansion surrogate, ideal for cases when complex computational models generating high-dimensional outputs are considered.

## Methods
GDM-PCE uses concepts from manifold learning 
(nonlinear dimensionallity reduction) and surrogate modeling (Polynomial chaos expansion or PCE) 

Details of the methdology can be found here: 

## Application

Three illustrative examples are provided. The first considers a dielectric cylinder suspended in a homogeneous electric field. The second is the classic Lotka-Volterra dynamical system modeling the evolution of two species interacting with each other, one a predator and one a prey. Finally, the third example considers a system of advection-diffusion-reaction equations which models a first-order chemical reaction between two species.
